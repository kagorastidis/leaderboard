# My own version of Leaderboard Meteor app

I m trying to learn Meteor.js and I made this app following the tutotial on <a href="http://meteortips.com/first-meteor-tutorial/" target="_blank"> MeteorTips</a>

I added some of my own functionality not included in the tutorial. See the demo and play with it. 

Important!

I haven't implemented any security on this project (autopublish is on, roles do not exist etc ), so do not use in production in any case. You can always fork and complete the security tasks ofc for the app to be functional in public.
